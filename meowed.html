<p><font size="6" face="Arial"><br>
The amount of meows (cat meows) on your Discord message has
increased by 1.<br>
<br>
</font><font size="7" face="Arial">Why did you do this?</font></p>

<p><font size="6" face="Arial"><br>
There are several reasons I may deem a message to be worthy of
cat meowing. These include, but are not limited to:<br>
Rudeness towards other cats, spreading incorrect information,
sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s....<br>
<br>
</font><font size="7" face="Arial">Am in your no-friends list?</font></p>

<p><font size="6" face="Arial"><br>
No - not yet. But you should refrain from sending messages like
this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an
additional meowing, which may put your friendship privileges in
jeopardy.<br>
<br>
</font><font size="7" face="Arial">How can I prevent this from
happening in the future?</font></p>

<p><font size="6" face="Arial"><br>
Accept the meow and move on. But learn from this mistake: your
behavior will not be tolerated on Discord.com. I will continue to
issue meows until you improve your conduct. Remember: Discord is
privilege, not a right.</font></p>
